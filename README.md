# Hi there, I'm Ebad! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m an **aspiring Machine Learning Engineer (BSCS)** passionate about **AI, NLP, and GenAI**. I love building **end-to-end ML solutions**, experimenting with LLMs, and turning ideas into real-world projects.

## 🚀 About Me

* 🎓 Transitioned from **SAP solutions** to **AI/ML engineering**, driven by curiosity for problem-solving.
* 🧠 Currently focused on **Transformers, RAG-powered apps, and Neural Networks**.
* 🎯 Building projects that combine **practical applications with deep technical learning**.
* 🎮 Gamer at heart. I see debugging and boss fights as two sides of the same challenge. ⚔️

## 🔥 Highlight Projects

* 🤖 **PregniSense – Proactive Pregnancy Risk Chatbot**
  Built with **LlamaIndex + Gemini**, deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**. Proactively asks health questions, retrieves WHO guidelines, and classifies risks (Low/Med/High).
